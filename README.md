# OpenGL Examples

This repository hosts a collection of sample codes that I've developed as I work through a book titled "Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL with C++." The primary goal of these examples is to reinforce my understanding of OpenGL. For the graphical rendering and mathematical computations, the projects utilize the GLFW and GLM libraries, respectively.


Included within the project are the GLM libraries in the form of header files. However, to successfully compile these examples, having GLFW installed is essential. Additionally, a selection of these samples leverages the OpenCV 4 library for specific functionalities.
